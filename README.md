# english-word-generator

Create a random English word generator. Use bootstrap or any other framework for the HTML, and apply your own styles for things like highlighting the generated word. Things like maintaining a history of words, etc. are a plus. You can code in either jQuery, pure Javascript, or a simple JS MVC framework of your choice
